## Fonts

I'm a big fan of Roboto, Lato, Helvetica... basically, just modern sans-serif fonts are usually my favorite.

## Preferences

* I like to use flexbox for laying out the content but, in the end, I guess it doesn't really matter how you do it.
* I typically like things to be centered.
* I like rounded corners on containers.
